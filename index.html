        <h1>What is procrastination?</h1>
        <div id="container">

        <p>Procrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something. It could be further stated as a habitual or intentional delay of starting or finishing a task despite knowing it might have negative consequences. It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner.  It is perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with depression, low self-esteem, guilt and inadequacy</p> </div>

    <div id="Why">
        <h1>Why do we procrastinate?</h1>
        <img src="https://procrastination.com/assets/frontend/img/procrastination-helpless.svg" alt="img">
        <p>People often procrastinate because they are averse to the tasks that they need to perform. For example, if you need to make an important phone call to someone you dislike, you might end up procrastinating instead of just getting it done, because you don’t want to talk to them.This occurs because, in general, the more people find a certain task unappealing, the more likely they are to want to avoid it, and therefore the more likely they are to procrastinate. People also procrastinate because they are afraid of being evaluated or because they are afraid of receiving negative feedback from others.</p>

        <h1>How to stop Procrastinating?</h1>
        <div id="work">
        <div class="box">
            <h2>1. Get organized</h2>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSpP11QxQnDSnxkxqnHLER0a7FWvqHYk34kLQ&usqp=CAU" alt="Img">
            <p>You can't do any work if you don't know what assignments need to be completed. Invest in a planner or start using the calendar app on your phone. This makes it much easier to keep track of individual assignments and important due dates.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>2. Set simple, achievable goals</h2>
            <img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/185327398.jpg?w=800&quality=85" alt="Img">
            <p>Part of the reason we procrastinate is because the task at hand seems too daunting. It’s a lot easier to get started on a project when you establish simple, reachable goals rather than a big, vague plan. Instead of telling yourself, "I'll study biology tonight,” say, "I'll study chapter six tonight." This makes your goals less intimidating and more attainable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>3. Set a deadline</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/how-to-stop-procrastinating-1024x768.jpeg" alt="Img">
            <p>So many people get trapped in the cycle of "Someday, I'll organize my notes," or "I'll get to that math homework eventually." The truth is “someday” and “eventually” never come. It's important to set a specific date for when you want your goals to be accomplished. If you have an assignment due, aim to have it completed one or two days in advance. That way, if something unexpected happens, you still have extra time to complete it. </p>

            <h2>4. Get rid of distractions</h2>

            <p>It’s important to rid yourself of all potential disruptions before you begin working so you don’t get needlessly sidetracked halfway through your task. If you tend to spend too much time on Snapchat or Instagram when you should be studying, then shut your phone off (all the way off). Distractions could also be external sources, like annoying siblings. Try listening to classical music or white noise to drown out their constant chatter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>5. Use incentives</h2>
            <img src="https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A1780-10-Ways-to-stop-procrastinating-while-designing-Image-5.jpg" alt="Img">
            <p>Everyone loves being rewarded. It’s important to give yourself incentives, no matter how small. It could be something as simple as, "If I work on this assignment for an hour, I'll watch an episode of my favorite TV show tonight." Or it could be a bigger goal like, "If I get an A in math this semester, I'll go to my favorite restaurant.” It’s easier to pay attention when something is at stake. </p>

        <p>Procrastination is the habit of delaying an important task, usually by focusing on less urgent, more enjoyable, and easier activities instead. Procrastination can restrict your potential and undermine your career. It can also disrupt teamwork, reduce morale, and even lead to depression and job loss. So, it's crucial to take proactive steps to prevent it. The first step to overcoming procrastination is to recognize that you're doing it. Then, identify the reasons behind your behavior and use appropriate strategies to manage and overcome it.</p></div>
